# VBox-SVGA3D-fuzzing

VirtualBox (and possibly VMware) SVGA3D Fuzzer (Targeting VMSVGA)

## Description

**Fuzzing SVGA3D** is implemented in this repository. It is done with an input model extracted from **VirtualBox SVGA3D headers**, generating and testing random SVGA3D commands. Random data are generated with semi-autogenerated codes, powered with ctypes and [ctypeslib](https://github.com/trolldbois/ctypeslib), which converts C header files into and adapted python code.

This fuzzer implements **a server-client model**, which has server part that runs in host, and client part that runs in guest VM. The server part (named host) controls the flow of fuzzing, and generates random data and send them to client. The client part (named worker) accepts the data and runs it, sending them to a SVGA pci device.

## Running the fuzzer

Host: Fix settings in `config.py`, and run `./fuzzer.py` (python 3)

Guest: Run `install_deps.sh`, `make`, and `sudo ./worker <server addr> <port>`
